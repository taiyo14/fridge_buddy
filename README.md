# Fridge Buddy

In this project, my aim was to tackle one of the more neglected problem of food waste.
Since we have an abundance of food, we tend to not think too much about
throwing food away. Many times what happens is that groceries get stacked up and hidden away, eventually forgotten and spoiled. However, small actions add up and so does the environmental  impact.

This app tackles the problem by allowing users to easily keep track of their food from the convenience of their phones. The user can track the expiration date and the buy date for some more sensitive foods.

One especially attractive use case is foods in the freezer. Reorganizing the freezer is such a tedious task due to your hands getting too cold. With Fridge Buddy, you can just see a list of everything in the fridge as a reminder, instead of going through the whole freezer.
