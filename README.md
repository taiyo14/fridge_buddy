# cs4750_project - Fridge Buddy

In this project, my aim was to tackle one of the more neglected problem of food waste.
Since we have so much abundance of food in America, we tend to not think  much about
throwing food away. However, small actions add up and so does the environmental  impact.

This app tackles the problem by allowing users to be able to better keep track of their food and
what they have. The user can keep track of the expiration date and for some more sensitive foods
that are better kept track by their buy date, it is also possible.

Although, this version is far from what it could be and needs a lot more time and love.
Currently, it can only store data locally and has many bugs.
