Fridge Buddy

In this project, my aim was to tackle one of the more neglected problem of food waste.
Since we have an abundance of food, we tend to not think  much about
throwing food away. However, small actions add up and so does the environmental  impact.

This app tackles the problem by allowing users to be able to better keep track of their food and
what they have. The user can keep track of the expiration date and for some more sensitive foods
that are better kept track by their buy date, it is also possible.


Framework: Flutter

Language: Dart

Current features include:
- Sorting entries by Name, Age, Expiration date, and favorites
- Responsive data entry and edits achieved through Stateful widgets
- Locally stored data through SharedPreferences

Work in progress:
- Uploading images
- Input verification
